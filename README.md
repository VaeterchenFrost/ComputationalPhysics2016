## Install:
With [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) on the system installed the dependencies for this project can be automatically installed in a new environment:

Go to the projects base directory.

Open a *conda-command-prompt* with admin privileges and run the commands from the project folder
- to create a new environment with basic dependencies:
```shell
conda env create -f .\environment.yml
```
- to activate the environment:
```shell
conda activate compphys2016
```

## How to use

With everything installed it comes down to running with the respective shell active just
```shell
python .\1_1_martin_roebke.py
```
